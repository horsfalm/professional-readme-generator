### Project Description
READme Generator is a tool created in Node which automates the creation of a structured READme file for any application. It is intended to comply with best practices for the creation of READme file and respect the importance of this critical document as part of the overall codebase of a project.<a name="description"><a>

### Installation
The user executes app.js from the CLI in bash or terminal and answers a series of questions in Inquirer. The questionnaire provides warnings when invalid responses are inputted except in instances where a default has been set (for example in the list type question for license choice, in which case MIT has been set as default). The READme file has been generated in Markdown using a template that includes a string literal. Once generated, the associated .md file can be committed to the respective repository where it will be rendered (this process is not automated).<a name="installation"><a>

### Usage
The project is intended to assist in creating consistently strong READme files which are structured in a standard way. During my time in the coding bootcap at UCB Extension, I have found that I tend to vary how I construct these important files and this tool is designed to ensure that nothing gets missed and there is a discipline in place to ensure a minimum standard of READMe file for every project that I, or any user of the tool, writes.<a name="usage"><a>
